Most of the changes are in combined_exploit.call; nonetheless I'd say that it follows the same general logic
I had to also adjust evm.py and some of the constraints.py stuff - but most of it for debugging purposes 

exploit_all_addr.py will run combined_call_exploit.py on a range of addresses using the ...Xa = callee ...Xb = CALLER scheme
    python exploit_all_addr.py 0 15
I usually trun debugging off to see only the model and exploits at the end of the contract run
it will also run with the "execute_exploit=True" that will send exploit transactions using the client   

You can also run combined_call_exploit on specififc addr; 
    python combined_call_exploit.py 0x400000000000000000000000000000000000000b 0x3cc7c038f7eea1b70014b788b821d675b13b8760 +1
I've deactiavted the option to use a contract.code file for the time being - it's simply commented out

Finally you can check the results using a terminal in teether-localhost with
    geth --exec 'loadScript("showBalance.js");getBalanceFrom("0x400000000000000000000000000000000000000b", 16)' attach http://127.0.0.1:8545
